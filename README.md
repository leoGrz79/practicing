# Practicing try/catch

## Disclaimer

A couple exercises to practice try/catch to test blocks of code for errors. Some of these were suggested by Trybe during my graduation and some were invented by me. Therefore, it's a mix of **full excercises** and a **simple JS files containing a few functions only.**
